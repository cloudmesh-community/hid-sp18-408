\section{IBM Db2 Big Sql}

IBM Db2 Big SQL is used to access, query and analyze data across data warehouse
and Hadoop.

It is a hybrid SQL engine that helps you use SQL on Hadoop and delivers data 
querying for the enterprise. It lets you use a single database connection or 
query to connect to disparate sources such as HDFS, RDMS, NoSQL databases, 
object stores and WebHDFS. It provides low latency, support for ad-hoc and 
complex queries, high performance, security, SQL compatibility and federation
capabilities to get the most from your data warehouse and SQL on Hadoop.
