\section{IBM Big Replicate}

IBM Big Replicate is an enterprise class replication for Hadoop and object 
store.

It delivers continuous availability, performance and guaranteed data 
consistency. It replicates big data from lab to production, from production to 
disaster recovery sites or, from ground to cloud object stores governed by the
most demanding business and regulatory requirements. The non-invasive 
technology replicates data as it streams in, eliminating the need for files 
to be fully written and closed before data transfer. Big Replicate offers 
flexible replication across supported Hadoop distributions and versions running
on supported Hadoop compatible storage systems and object stores.
